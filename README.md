# üöÄ Employee Management System - Backend Documentation

This document outlines the server-side architecture, technologies, and configurations for the **Employee Management System** backend. It is designed to handle authentication, role-based access control, data management, and integration with the frontend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
- Role-based access control for Admin, HR, and Employee functionalities.

### RESTful API Endpoints
- Fully-featured CRUD operations for managing employees, tasks, payroll, and user roles.
- Middleware for validating user roles and permissions.

### Data Management
- MongoDB as the database for storing user, task, and payroll data.

### Payment Processing
- Payment gateway integration for secure and seamless salary transactions.
- Ensures unique salary payments for each month/year combination.

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient query handling using indexed database fields.
- Data filtering and pagination for large datasets.

### Secure Configuration
- Environment variables to protect sensitive data like database credentials and JWT secrets.
- Sanitized inputs to prevent injection attacks.
